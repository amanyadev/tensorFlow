tensorFlow implemented to Unity using the ML-Agents package. The repository demonstrate machine learning with the help of a simple Pong game. 
# Pong automated with Tensorflow.

Pong is one of the games that you must have played atleast one if there were any nintendos lying around you. I attempted to attach tensorflow to it to automate one of the paddles.


# Requirements

  - pip or anaconda
  - Unity(2018.1 or higher)
  - ml-agnents by Unity
### Installation

Install the dependencies using pip. Go to the folder
`tensorFlow/Pong/Assets/ml-agents-master/python/`


```sh
$ pip install .
```

Refer to the repository https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started-with-Balance-Ball.md
it has all the basics to start training your first bot.
